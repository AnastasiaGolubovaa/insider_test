Describe the steps for comprehensively testing of a pencil with an eraser on one
end. Cases for all types of testing (such as functional, usability, performance, load,
stress, security, etc.) are expected here.


Test cases for a pencil with an eraser on one

functional:
1. check if the pencil can write
2. check if it is possible to erase what was written
3. check if it's possible to sharpen it
4. check if sharpen on both sides
5. check the pencil during storage and transfer(one and more pencils)
6. check the different colours of pencils
7. is it possible to take it in your hand/ to another hand?


usability:
1. check if  pencil is convenient to write
2. check if it's convenient to sharpen
3. check what are we holding on to
4. check what size is it


performance:
1. check how long pencil and eraser can be used
2. check behaviour if using pencil 24/7

load:
1. check behaviour with pressure during using a eraser
2. check behaviour with pressure during using a pencil

stress:
1. check behaviour with dropping a pencil
2. check behaviour with tearing the eraser off the pencil
3. check behaviour with breaking the lead
4. check behaviour with bending the pencil

security:
1. if bite/chew/swallow, will you get poisoned?
2. is it possible to cause harm with a pencil?
